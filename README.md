# pipex
pipex is a command-line utility that mimics the functionality of the pipe operator in shell commands. It allows you to redirect the output of one command as the input of another command, similar to the shell syntax "command1 | command2". With pipex, you can specify two commands and an input/output file, and it will execute the commands, redirecting the output from the first command as the input to the second command.
